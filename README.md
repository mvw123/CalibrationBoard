CalibrationBoard
================

Reference board for calibration of Voltage, current, resistance Capacitance and Inductance
The design is created in Eagle CAD v 6.5.0 (free version) and uses the standard PCB board size.

CAD A - [WIP]
====================================

The board has been manufactured at PCB fabricator ITead
Some issues have been boted with the PCB. See issues list in github. 

Voltage reference -> 2.5V and 5.0V < 10mA load
Current Reference -> Configurable up to 10A max
Resistance references -> Various tight tolerance resistors <=1 ohm = 1%, >1 ohm = 0.1%
Capacitors -> TBD
Inductors -> TBD
