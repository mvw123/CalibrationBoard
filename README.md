CalibrationBoard
================

Reference board for calibration of Voltage, current and resistance


CAD A - WIP
===========
Voltage reference -> 2.5V and 5.0V < 10mA load
Current Reference -> Configurable up to 10A max
Resistance references -> Various tight tolerance resistors <=1 ohm = 1%, >1 ohm = 0.1%
